# Admin API

The Admin API is designed for administrative operations and management of your e-commerce platform. It provides endpoints for managing products, orders, customers, and other backend operations.

## Overview

The Admin API requires elevated permissions and is typically used by:

- Admin dashboards and panels
- Internal management tools
- Automated backend processes
- Integration with third-party admin tools

All Admin API endpoints are prefixed with `/admin`. Authentication with admin credentials is required for all requests.

## Authentication

Admin API requests must include an admin authentication token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.yourcompany.com/admin/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.yourcompany.com/admin/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN}`
  }
})
```

```python
import requests

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN}'}
response = requests.get('https://api.yourcompany.com/admin/products', headers=headers)
```

## Base URL

During development, the Admin API endpoints will be available under the path `/admin`:

`http://localhost:9000/admin`

For production, replace with your backend URL.

## Permissions

Admin API access requires specific permissions based on the operation:

1. **Read permissions** - View and retrieve data
2. **Write permissions** - Create and update resources
3. **Delete permissions** - Remove resources
4. **Super admin permissions** - Full access to all operations

## Rate Limiting

Admin API requests are subject to rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- **100 requests per minute** for standard operations
- **500 requests per minute** for super admin users
- Rate limit headers are included in all responses

## Common Operations

### Managing Products

Create, update, and delete products in your catalog.

### Processing Orders

View and manage customer orders, update order statuses, and process refunds.

### Customer Management

Access customer data, manage customer accounts, and view customer history.

### Analytics & Reports

Generate reports, view analytics data, and export information for analysis.

## Error Handling

Admin API errors include detailed information for debugging:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PERMISSION_DENIED",
    "message": "You do not have permission to perform this action",
    "details": {
      "required_permission": "products.write",
      "current_permissions": ["products.read"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate permissions** - Grant only the permissions needed for each admin user
2. **Rotate tokens regularly** - Update admin tokens on a regular schedule
3. **Log all operations** - Keep audit logs of all admin actions
4. **Validate input** - Always validate and sanitize input data
5. **Use pagination** - Limit result sets to improve performance

## Getting Started

To start using the Admin API:

1. Obtain admin credentials from your account settings
2. Generate an admin API token
3. Make your first authenticated request
4. Explore the available endpoints and operations
