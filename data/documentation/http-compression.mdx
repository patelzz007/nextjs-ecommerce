# HTTP Compression

Our API supports HTTP compression to reduce bandwidth usage and improve response times.

## Supported Compression Methods

We support the following compression algorithms:

- **gzip** - Most widely supported compression method
- **deflate** - Alternative compression method
- **br** (Brotli) - Modern compression with better ratios

## Using Compression

To enable compression, include the `Accept-Encoding` header in your request:

\`\`\`bash
curl https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br"
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br'
  }
})
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br'
}
response = requests.get('https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products', headers=headers)
\`\`\`

## Compression Benefits

Using compression can reduce response sizes by 60-80% on average:

| Response Type | Uncompressed | Compressed | Savings |
|---------------|--------------|------------|---------|
| JSON (small)  | 2 KB         | 0.5 KB     | 75%     |
| JSON (large)  | 100 KB       | 20 KB      | 80%     |
| Text          | 50 KB        | 15 KB      | 70%     |

## Best Practices

- Always include `Accept-Encoding` header for better performance
- Most HTTP clients handle compression automatically
- Check the `Content-Encoding` response header to verify compression
- Use Brotli when available for best compression ratios
