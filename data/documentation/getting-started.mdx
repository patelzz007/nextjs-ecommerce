# Getting Started

Welcome to our API documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating our API into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An API key from your dashboard
- Node.js 16+ or Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to make your first API call:

### 1. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @your-company/api-sdk
```

```python
pip install your-company-sdk
```

### 2. Initialize the Client

```javascript
import { APIClient } from '@your-company/api-sdk'

const client = new APIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
})
```

```python
from your_company import APIClient

client = APIClient(api_key=os.environ.get('API_KEY'))
```

### 3. Make Your First Request

```javascript
const response = await client.products.list({
  limit: 10,
  status: 'published'
})

console.log(response.data)
```

```python
response = client.products.list(
    limit=10,
    status='published'
)

print(response.data)
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
curl https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Free tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro tier**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits
