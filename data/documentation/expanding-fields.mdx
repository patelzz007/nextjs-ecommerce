# Expanding Fields

By default, our API returns minimal data to keep responses fast. You can expand related fields to include additional data in a single request.

## Using the Expand Parameter

Add the `expand` query parameter to include related data:

\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/orders/123?expand=customer,products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/orders/123?expand=customer,products',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
import requests

params = {'expand': 'customer,products'}
response = requests.get(
  'https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/orders/123',
  headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'},
  params=params
)
\`\`\`

## Available Expansions

Different endpoints support different expansions:

| Endpoint | Available Expansions |
|----------|---------------------|
| /orders  | customer, products, shipping_address |
| /products | category, variants, images |
| /customers | orders, addresses, payment_methods |

## Nested Expansions

You can expand nested relationships using dot notation:

\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/orders/123?expand=customer.addresses,products.category" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`

## Performance Considerations

- Expanding fields increases response size and time
- Only expand fields you need
- Use pagination with expansions to avoid large responses
- Some expansions may count against rate limits differently
