# Authentication

Our API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in your dashboard.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your requests. Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy your key and store it securely

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

\`\`\`bash
curl https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
  }
})
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
import requests

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'}
response = requests.get('https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products', headers=headers)
\`\`\`

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Store keys in environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
- Implement IP whitelisting when possible

## Error Codes
