# Selecting Fields

Reduce response size by requesting only the fields you need using the `fields` parameter.

## Basic Field Selection

\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products?fields=id,name,price" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products?fields=id,name,price',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
import requests

params = {'fields': 'id,name,price'}
response = requests.get(
  'https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/products',
  headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'},
  params=params
)
\`\`\`

## Response Comparison

Without field selection:

\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "prod_123",
  "name": "T-Shirt",
  "price": 29.99,
  "description": "A comfortable cotton t-shirt",
  "inventory": 100,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
\`\`\`

With field selection (`fields=id,name,price`):

\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "prod_123",
  "name": "T-Shirt",
  "price": 29.99
}
\`\`\`

## Combining with Expand

You can combine field selection with expansions:

\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/orders?expand=customer&fields=id,total,customer.name,customer.email" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`
